Artikel,Cultural Revolutions: how dub conquered britain,"With its heavy beat of drum and bass, and the hypnotic spacing of reverb and echo, dub is a world apart from the music it grew from – the reggae of artists such as Bob Marley and Desmond Dekker.
But it emerged from the same ghettos of Kingston in Jamaica, half a century ago. And Britain is where dub found its most fervent adopted home – thanks in large part to the Windrush generation that arrived from the Caribbean after the second world war. A cultural legacy that is now being celebrated in a new exhibition, which opens at the Museum of London on Friday.
“It’s a soundtrack of our lives,” said Mad Professor, 65, whose real name is Neil Fraser. He moved to England from Guyana when he was 15 in 1970. It was a time when white music dominated the radio – the Beatles and Rolling Stones – and immigrants, he said, felt culturally alienated.

Artikel,What does Cyberghetto mean? - invloed van buurt op fashion,"Many have pointed out the issue with the aesthetic being credited towards 2000s era socialites, like Paris Hilton, while overlooking the strong influence from hip-hop and R&B singers of that era like TLC, Blaque, Lil Kim, Aaliyah, Destiny’s Child, and many more.
In spite of the term  originating from a person of color, some POC find the term to be offensive.
This sort of reaction is fair, considering oftentimes fashion and beauty trends pioneered by Black people are deemed “ghetto” and “unprofessional” until worn by someone who is white or white passing.

Artikel,A cultural history of the corner shop,"The corner shop is also a cornerstone of pop culture. Over the years, this cosy setting has been portrayed in numerous soap operas, sitcoms and movies, as a social hub and often a spot for gossip. Arguably the most famous British example is the classic BBC sitcom Open All Hours, which ran for four series between 1976 and 1985, featuring the late Ronnie Barker as stammering, tight-fisted shopkeeper Albert Arkwright, and David Jason as his hapless nephew/assistant Granville (Jason recently reprised this role in Still Open All Hours). The show remains incredibly resonant, not only through its fruity comedy and slapstick scenes (Arkwright: “I hate that scrunching sound errand boys make when you have to stand on them”), but also through its unmistakeable poignance; each episode would satisfyingly conclude with Arkwright’s twilight monologue, as he shut up shop.’ Britain’s tiny island has often been branded ‘a nation of shopkeepers’ – it’s a phrase that was once believed to be a Napoleonic insult, though it was positively declared by Scottish economist/philosopher Adam Smith, in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations. The staple British corner shop as we know it dates back to Victorian times; much would also be made of so-called ‘Iron Lady’ UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher’s background as a grocer’s daughter: the corner shop represented humble yet sturdy trade. Our sense of quaint pride in its identity and evolution (from formal counter-service to grab-and-go purchases) was recently portrayed in a BBC reality documentary, Back in Time for the Corner Shop, where a real-life Sheffield family lived and worked as local shop retailers, in ‘eras’ spanning the late 19th Century to the 1990s.",A cultural history of the corner shop.png,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200325-a-cultural-history-of-the-beloved-corner-shop
